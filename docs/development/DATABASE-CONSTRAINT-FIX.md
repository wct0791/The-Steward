# Database Constraint Error Fix

## Issue Fixed ✅

**Error:** `SQLITE_CONSTRAINT: NOT NULL constraint failed: model_performance.response_time_ms`

**Root Cause:**  
The `model_performance.response_time_ms` field was defined as `INTEGER NOT NULL` in the database schema, but the performance logger was setting it to `null` when no performance data was available during routing decisions.

## Solution Applied

**File:** `src/core/performance-logger.js`  
**Line:** 63

**Before:**
```javascript
response_time_ms: performanceData.response_time_ms || null,
```

**After:**
```javascript
response_time_ms: performanceData.response_time_ms || 0, // Default to 0 when not available
```

## Why This Fix Works

1. **Preserves Data Integrity:** Uses `0` as a default value for routing decisions where response time hasn't been measured yet
2. **Non-Breaking:** Doesn't require database schema changes
3. **Logical Default:** `0` milliseconds indicates no execution time (routing decision only)
4. **Backward Compatible:** Existing performance data with actual response times is unaffected

## Database Schema Context

The `model_performance` table has these NOT NULL constraints:
- ✅ `model_name TEXT NOT NULL` - Already handled with defaults
- ✅ `adapter_type TEXT NOT NULL` - Already handled with defaults  
- ✅ `response_time_ms INTEGER NOT NULL` - **Fixed** with default value `0`
- ✅ `success BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE` - Already handled with defaults

## Verification Results

### Before Fix:
```
❌ Failed to log routing performance: SQLITE_CONSTRAINT: NOT NULL constraint failed: model_performance.response_time_ms
```
