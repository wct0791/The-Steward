# Runtime Error Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ **cognitive_context is not defined**
**Location:** `smart-routing-engine.js` lines 626, 784, 803, 842
**Problem:** Code was referencing old variable name `cognitive_context` but the actual variable was `cognitive_state`

**Fixes Applied:**
- Line 626: Fixed `applyCognitiveAdjustments` call parameter
- Line 784: Fixed destructuring in `generateSmartFallbackChain` 
- Line 803: Fixed cognitive state access in fallback generation
- Line 842: Fixed logging data structure

### 2. ❌ **alignment_score is not defined**
**Location:** `cognitive-profile-manager.js` and `smart-routing-engine.js`
**Problem:** `analyzeTaskCognitiveAlignment` returned `score` but code expected `alignment_score`

**Fixes Applied:**
- `cognitive-profile-manager.js:345`: Added `alignment_score` property (keeping `score` for compatibility)
- `smart-routing-engine.js:716-760`: Completely rewrote `applyCognitiveAdjustments` method to work with new cognitive state structure
- Added safe property access with `?.` operator for robustness

### 3. ⚠️ **Safe Property Access**
**Problem:** Potential undefined property access in cognitive profile code

**Fixes Applied:**
- Added optional chaining (`?.`) for `neurotype_adaptations` access
- Added safe access for `cognitiveCapacity.factors` properties

## ✅ **Verification Results**

### Syntax Validation:
```bash
✅ smart-routing-engine.js - Syntax OK
✅ cognitive-profile-manager.js - Syntax OK  
✅ All core files - Syntax OK
```

### Runtime Testing:
```bash
✅ Main demo runs successfully
✅ Smart routing decisions working
✅ All routing components integrated:
   - Time-aware routing ✅
   - Cognitive profile integration ✅ 
   - Task classification ✅
   - Local-first routing ✅
   - Character sheet preferences ✅
   - Performance logging ✅ (minor DB constraint warning)
```

### Example Working Output:
```
🐛 Debug Task (Technical)
📝 Task: "This React component is re-rendering infinitely..."
🏷️  Classification: debug (confidence: 100.0%)
🤖 Selected Model: smollm3
📊 Confidence: 100.0%
⚡ Routing Strategy: privacy_local_only
⏰ Time Context: evening (energy: medium)
🧠 Cognitive Capacity: low (score: 40.0%)
🏠 Privacy Level: medium
🔒 Requires Local: Yes
💭 Reasoning: Intelligent tier selection → Cognitive adjustments → Privacy protection
🔄 Fallbacks: codellama, smollm3-1.7b, smollm3-8b

## 🟢 **Status: RESOLVED**

The smart routing engine is now fully functional with all runtime errors fixed. The system successfully demonstrates:

- **Time-aware routing** based on time of day and energy levels
- **Cognitive profile integration** with ADHD awareness and task alignment  
- **Local-first routing** with automatic privacy protection
- **Character sheet preferences** mapping to model selection
- **Performance logging integration** with database tracking
- **Multi-layered fallback chains** for reliability

The only minor issue is a database constraint warning for missing `response_time_ms` in performance logging, which doesn't affect core functionality.
