## Core Implementation: 4 Learning Components

### 1. Preference Drift Detection Algorithm
**Goal:** Identify when actual usage diverges from character sheet defaults

**Implementation Requirements:**
- **Data Analysis:** Compare routing decisions vs character sheet preferences
- **Pattern Recognition:** Detect systematic deviations ("always picks Claude for explanations despite GPT-4 preference")
- **Confidence Scoring:** Quantify drift significance and consistency
- **API Endpoint:** `POST /api/learning/analyze-drift` returning drift patterns

**Expected Output:**
```javascript
{
  "driftPatterns": [
    {
      "taskType": "debug",
      "characterSheetPreference": "gpt-4",
      "actualUsagePattern": "claude",
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "occurrences": 12,
      "timespan": "2 weeks"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Confidence Calibration System
**Goal:** Learn when high-confidence routing decisions are actually wrong

**Implementation Requirements:**
- **Feedback Correlation:** Map user feedback to routing confidence scores
- **Accuracy Tracking:** Identify systematic overconfidence patterns
- **Calibration Adjustment:** Develop confidence scaling algorithms
- **Learning Loop:** Update routing confidence based on validation feedback

**Expected Behavior:**
- Track when 95% confidence decisions get negative feedback
- Adjust confidence algorithms to improve prediction accuracy
- Provide "learning confidence" scores that improve over time

### 3. Character Sheet Evolution Engine
**Goal:** Generate smart suggestions for updating user preferences

**Implementation Requirements:**
- **Smart Suggestions API:** `GET /api/learning/character-sheet-suggestions`
- **Change Recommendation Logic:** Analyze patterns and propose specific updates
- **Impact Estimation:** Predict improvement from suggested changes
- **UI Integration:** Beautiful suggestion cards in dashboard

**Expected Suggestions Format:**
```javascript
{
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "type": "task_preference_update",
      "current": "debug: gpt-4",
      "suggested": "debug: claude",
      "reasoning": "85% of debug tasks routed to Claude with positive feedback",
      "confidence": 0.92,
      "estimatedImprovement": "15% faster routing, 23% better accuracy"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Learning Progress Visualization
**Goal:** Show how The Steward is getting smarter about workflow patterns

**Implementation Requirements:**
- **Learning Metrics Dashboard:** New tab in PerformanceDashboard
- **Progress Indicators:** Visual charts showing accuracy improvement over time
- **Achievement System:** ADHD-friendly milestones and progress unlocks
- **Intelligence Growth Charts:** Routing accuracy, preference learning, confidence calibration

**Visual Components:**
- **Learning Curve Chart:** Routing accuracy improvement over time
- **Preference Alignment Score:** How well current routing matches actual usage
- **Smart Suggestions Accepted:** Track when user adopts system recommendations
- **Achievement Badges:** "Week 1 Learning Complete", "Preference Master", etc.

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Database Schema Extensions
**Enhance existing SQLite schema with learning tables:**

```sql
-- Add to existing database
CREATE TABLE learning_patterns (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    pattern_type TEXT,
    pattern_data JSON,
    confidence REAL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    validated_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE confidence_calibration (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    routing_decision_id INTEGER,
    predicted_confidence REAL,
    actual_feedback_score REAL,
    calibration_error REAL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE character_sheet_suggestions (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    suggestion_type TEXT,
    current_value TEXT,
    suggested_value TEXT,
    reasoning TEXT,
    confidence REAL,
    status TEXT, -- pending, accepted, rejected
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### API Endpoints to Build
**Add to `steward-web-app/api/analytics.js`:**

```javascript
// Learning analysis endpoints
app.post('/api/learning/analyze-drift', analyzeDriftPatterns);
app.get('/api/learning/confidence-calibration', getConfidenceCalibration);
app.get('/api/learning/character-sheet-suggestions', getCharacterSheetSuggestions);
app.post('/api/learning/accept-suggestion', acceptSuggestion);
app.get('/api/learning/progress-metrics', getLearningProgressMetrics);
```

### Frontend Integration
**Enhance `PerformanceDashboard.js` with new Learning tab:**

```javascript
// Add 5th tab: Learning Progress
const dashboardTabs = [
  'Routing Trends',
  'Model Performance', 
  'Cognitive Patterns',
  'Learning Insights',
  'Learning Progress'  // NEW TAB
];
```

## Success Metrics

### Week 1 Targets:
- **Preference Drift Detection:** Functional algorithm identifying usage patterns
- **Confidence Calibration:** Basic feedback correlation working
- **Character Sheet Suggestions:** At least 3 smart recommendations generated
- **Learning Visualization:** Progress charts displaying improvement metrics

### Week 2 Validation:
- **Improved Routing Accuracy:** Measurable increase in correct model selection
- **Preference Learning:** System adapts to real usage vs. character sheet defaults
- **User Adoption:** Chip accepts suggested character sheet improvements
- **ADHD Alignment:** Reduced context switching, better hyperfocus support

## ADHD-Aware Development Notes

### Cognitive Load Management:
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Don't overwhelm with all learning insights at once
- **Visual Progress:** Clear charts showing improvement over time
- **Achievement Unlocks:** Gamify learning milestones for dopamine hits
- **Simple Decisions:** Make suggestion acceptance/rejection effortless

### Hyperfocus Optimization:
- **Context Preservation:** Learn when Chip is in deep work mode
- **Flow State Protection:** Avoid disruptive routing changes during focus sessions
- **Energy Level Adaptation:** Different routing for high vs. low cognitive capacity

---

## Implementation Priority

### Session Focus (45-60 minutes):
1. **Start:** Preference drift detection algorithm (20 minutes)
2. **Core:** Character sheet suggestions engine (25 minutes)  
3. **Polish:** Learning progress visualization (15 minutes)
4. **Stretch:** Confidence calibration if time permits

### Technical Approach:
- **Build incrementally:** Each component should work independently
- **Test continuously:** Verify with existing analytics data
- **UI integration:** Ensure new features fit seamlessly into dashboard
- **Database first:** Set up learning tables before building algorithms
