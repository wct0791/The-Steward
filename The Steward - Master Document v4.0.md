# The Steward - Master Document v4
**Version:** 4.0  
**Last Updated:** July 29, 2025  
**Status:** Phase 2 Complete - Enhanced CLI Active

-----
## Executive Summary

The Steward is a local-first AI coordination system that intelligently routes tasks to the most appropriate AI model (local or cloud-based) based on user-defined preferences, context, and task requirements. It serves as a privacy-conscious intermediary that reduces direct API usage while maintaining conversation context through persistent memory.

**Core Value Proposition:** Transform disconnected AI interactions into a coherent, context-aware workflow that learns preferences, preserves privacy, and optimizes resource usage through intelligent routing and comprehensive fallback mechanisms.

**Current Status:** Phase 2 complete with enhanced CLI routing engine, sophisticated task classification, and comprehensive error handling systems operational.

## Project Vision

### The Problem

Modern AI tools are trapped in ephemeral chat UIs with no memory, limited context, and no real access to where users' work and life actually happen. They treat users as generic entities rather than specific humans with goals, preferences, and workflows.

### The Solution

Build a local-first, trustable AI coordination system that:
- **Remembers context** across sessions and projects
- **Routes intelligently** between local and cloud models with confidence scoring
- **Protects privacy** by default with configurable boundaries
- **Learns preferences** without compromising user agency
- **Integrates workflows** through automation bridges
- **Provides transparency** in all routing decisions and system operations
