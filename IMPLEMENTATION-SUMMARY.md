I've successfully implemented a comprehensive enhanced CLI system for The Steward that follows the master document specifications and significantly improves upon the existing architecture.

## üìã Core Components Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Routing Engine (`src/core/routing-engine.js`)
- **Sophisticated Task Classification**: Multi-pattern keyword matching with confidence scoring
- **Intelligent Model Selection**: Character sheet preferences with tier and use-case overrides
- **Dynamic Fallback Chains**: Automatic generation of fallback models based on context
- **Validation System**: Pre-flight checks for routing decisions

### 2. Enhanced CLI Handler (`src/core/cli-handler.js`)
- **Comprehensive Argument Parsing**: Full range of CLI options with validation
- **Configuration Management**: Seamless character sheet and loadout merging
- **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with detailed error reporting
- **Memory Integration**: Context-aware memory loading and management
- **Interactive Feedback**: User satisfaction collection for system improvement

### 3. Enhanced Logger (`models/enhanced-logger.js`)
- **Structured Logging**: JSONL format with categorized log files
- **Performance Metrics**: Detailed tracking of routing decisions and model performance
- **Feedback Integration**: User feedback correlation with routing decisions
- **Analytics Functions**: Built-in performance analysis and log management

### 4. Utility Improvements
- **Docker Runner**: Enhanced Docker model integration with multiple response formats
- **Migration Helper**: Guided transition from legacy to enhanced system
- **System Status Checker**: Comprehensive health monitoring and diagnostic tool

## üöÄ Key Features Delivered

### Advanced Routing Capabilities
- **Task Type Detection**: 10+ task types with confidence scoring
- **Model Preferences**: Character sheet integration with override options
- **Tier-based Selection**: Fast, high-quality, balanced, backup model preferences  
- **Use Case Optimization**: Specialized routing for write, debug, research, etc.
- **Intelligent Fallbacks**: Cloud ‚Üí Local ‚Üí Docker ‚Üí Final fallback chains

### Comprehensive CLI Interface
```bash
# Basic usage
node steward-enhanced.js "Debug this code"

# Advanced options
node steward-enhanced.js "Research AI trends" \
  --loadout research_mode \
  --prefer-tier high-quality \
  --memory on \
  --verbose

# Development features
node steward-enhanced.js "Test task" --dry-run --verbose
```

### Robust Error Handling
- **Multiple Fallback Layers**: Automatic failover between model types
- **Detailed Error Reporting**: Clear error messages with context
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when models fail
- **Audit Trails**: Complete logging of all attempts and outcomes

### Performance Monitoring
- **Real-time Metrics**: Response times, success rates, confidence scores
- **Usage Analytics**: Model usage patterns and performance trends
- **Feedback Loop**: User satisfaction tracking for continuous improvement
- **Health Monitoring**: System status checks and diagnostic tools

## üìä Architecture Improvements

### Before (Legacy System)
- Basic task type inference
